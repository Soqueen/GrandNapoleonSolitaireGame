        android:text="Three generations of our family have been playing this solitaire for over 100 years. There are other Napoleon solitaires which can be found with a Google search, but this version is considered to be unique. While we believe it was played by Emperor Napoleon while exiled in Elba, but we cannot confirm this. It is intellectually demanding and not all dealt tableaus are solvable.

\nTo preserve the game/design and make it available to others, this first implementation has been done by two McGill undergraduate Computer Science students as a development project as part of the ECSE 457 course. We hope that tablet owners will enjoy the challenge of a difficult solitaire and we believe that this mental exercise will help people of all ages to improve their memory and logical analysis capabilities.

\nThe concept, design and mode of play was supplied by Gerald Ratzer and the implementation was supervised by Joseph Vybihal. As this is a first version, feedback on how to improve the game is appreciated with an email to gerald.ratzer@mcgill.ca \n
