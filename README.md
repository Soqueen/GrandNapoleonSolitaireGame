# GrandNapoleonSolitaireGame
#####This is a single player card game, which involves evaluation of options and forward planning. While the initial deal and layout of the tableau with a matrix of 52 cards is random, the play of the hand ranges from easy to impossible. The GNS App will shuffle a regular deck of cards and deal the tableau. The play will be on an Android tablet using a drag and drop interface. The development of GNS will be in Java and enforce the strict set of GNS rules and logic.
